New business:
===========

Issues to fix:

1 Fix the page numbers.

2 Version Number should start with 0 while not released

3 Update the references. (Fix the format and possibly remove any bits not needed)

4 Ask Yassir/Chris if there should be a main menu since requirements mentioned "When the game starts up, it will prompt the users for the name of each of the four players...".

5 Change inputs to ensure repeatability.

6 Add another test to limit name length maybe.

7 Improve input for SE-04-008.

8 [SE 04-013] Change passing criteria to check if last card from the top is no longer on the top .

9 [SE-04-019] Ensure that once all treasure of a specific type has been assigned elsewhere then the request to obtain that type of treasure from treasure island should be rejected.

10 [SE-04-020 and SE-04-021] Make input more repeatable (for e.g. pick the same amount of cards every time).

11 [SE-04-021] Change passing criteria from “wanted” to “are allowed”.

12 [SE-04-024] Change passing criteria: Check if correct treasure is present instead of just the number of treasures.

13 [SE-04-026] Change test to keep track of the player's home port throuoghout the game instead of the treasures on it.

14 [SE-04-029] Check if test is a duplicate of test SE-04-026 as they are both keeping track of the home ports. 

15 [SE-04-038] Update input to “Begin the game" as they dont need to do anything yet to be assigned a home port. (Basically remove pick up 5 cards)

16 [SE-04-039] Output and passing criteria should just reference trading port, not home port.

17 [SE-04-040] Update test content to “total value must be 8”. Update input and output as well.

18 [SE-04-43] Update output to give a warning that ship cannot turn.

19 [SE-04-46] Update test content, output and passing criteria to follow the requirements spec about attacking being a must instead of optional.

21 [SE-04-50] Update passing criteria to specify that player can hold a maximum of two treasure.

22 [SE-04-53] Update passing criteria.

23 [SE-04-56] Update content, input and passing criteria.

24 [SE-04-62] Update output and passing criteria to say player is given/dealt the cards.
